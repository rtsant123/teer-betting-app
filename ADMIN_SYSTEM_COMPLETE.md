- **Task Assignment Control**: Only admins can assign tasks

## 🚀 How to Test the Complete System

### 1. Verify Backend is Running
```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Test API accessibility
curl http://localhost:8001/
```

### 2. Access Admin Dashboard
1. Open browser to `http://localhost` 
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
4. Use the User Management and Task Management tabs

### 3. Test Admin User Creation
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → User Management
2. Fill out the admin user creation form
3. Assign appropriate roles
4. Verify user creation in backend

### 4. Test Task Assignment
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Task Management  
2. Create a new task assignment
3. Set priority, due date, and description
4. Assign to an admin user
5. Track task status

## 📊 Database Verification

### Check Admin Tasks Table
```sql
-- Connect to PostgreSQL (localhost:5434)
SELECT * FROM admin_tasks;

-- Check enum types
SELECT typname FROM pg_type WHERE typtype = 'e' AND typname LIKE '%task%';
```

### Verify Migration Status
```bash
cd backend
alembic current
# Should show: 009_add_admin_tasks (head)
```

## 🎯 Available Task Types
- **RESULT_MANAGEMENT**: For managing betting results
- **PAYMENT_APPROVAL**: For approving withdrawals/deposits
- **USER_MANAGEMENT**: For user verification and management
- **HOUSE_MANAGEMENT**: For managing betting houses
- **SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE**: For system maintenance tasks

## 🔐 Required Permissions
- **Super Admin**: Can create other admins, assign all task types
- **Admin**: Can manage results, approve payments, manage users
- **Moderator**: Limited permissions for specific task types

## 🎨 Frontend Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Form Validation**: Proper input validation and error handling
- **Real-time Updates**: Status updates reflect immediately
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive admin dashboard

## 🔄 Next Steps for Production
1. **Create Initial Admin User**: Set up the first super admin
2. **Configure Role Hierarchy**: Define specific permissions per role
3. **Set Up Task Notifications**: Email/SMS notifications for task assignments
4. **Add Task Analytics**: Dashboard for task completion metrics
5. **Implement Task Comments**: Allow admins to add notes to tasks

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
- **Migration Issues**: Run `alembic upgrade head` to ensure all migrations are applied
- **Permission Errors**: Verify user has `is_admin=True` and appropriate role
- **Frontend Not Loading**: Check if both frontend and backend containers are running
- **Database Connection**: Verify PostgreSQL is accessible on port 5434

## 🎊 Success Metrics
✅ Database schema properly created and migrated  
✅ All admin endpoints working and secured  
✅ Frontend dashboard functional and responsive  
✅ Role-based access control implemented  
✅ Task management system fully operational  
✅ User management system complete
